      This app retrieves the user's location through the Geolocation API and
      uses it to find concerts featuring the inputted artists and within radius
      you enter. After you have search results, you can sort them by distance.
      Please note that the token is not included on Github because I was
      hesitant to put it on a public repository. The config.js file imported in
      main.js has been uploaded as a comment on my Canvas submission.

    <p>
      This submission satisfies the project requirements because it uses two
      different API's and is responsive. It allows users to search for concerts,
      displays the results, and then allows you to sort them. Filtering happens,
      but it's in the inital search. I will be honest I was sick all last week
      and banged this thing out today, so it's kind of sloppy. I spent most of
      my time wrestling with CORS issues and figuring out chaining ".then"'s so I could actually
      display results.
